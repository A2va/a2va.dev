					Hi, I'm A2va, I'm currently studying for a Bachelor's degree in
					Computer Science, and in my spare time I work on projects that I hope
					will be useful to others. My projects are quite diverse as I enjoy
					exploring and testing new ideas. That's where my pseudonym "A2va"
					comes from, inspired by the French phrase "√† tout va", which literally
					means "in all directions".
